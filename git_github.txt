Adding SSH Keys -
https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/about-ssh

To see all the files including hidden : ls -la 

git status
git add .
git commit -m "adding hello world"
git push origin main



Make a local repository a Git -
git init
<after commit and befor pushing create a repo on Github, then fire the below command>
git remote add origin git@github.com:SuvroBaner/demo-repo-2.git
git remote -v
git push -u origin master

Git Branching -

Master/Main Branch
Feature Branch
Hot Fix Branch

git branch
git checkout -b feature-nameoftheusecase     (to create a new branch)
git checkout main

Difference before merging -

git diff feature-nameoftheusecase
git status
git push --set-upstream origin feature-readme-instructions    ..(set-upstream is same as -u)


What is a pull request or a PR ?
A request to have your code pulled into another branch. Anyone can review our code, comment on it and ask us to make changes or updates
Here, we have made a PR from a feature branch to a master branch
Once the PR is merged, you will generally delete your feature or source branch and switch back to the master/main branch
Then if you need to make additional coding changes, you will create another new branch and start the process over.

SO, now go Github and do "Compare & Pull Request" .. add comments and then "Merge".

After that, you can come back to the local env, go to the "main" branch and then do a git pull to get the latest from the Github

git pull origin main 
(or)
git pull

Now you don't reuse branches which you have already merged into the main.
So, I am going to delete this branch

git branch -d feature-readme-instructions 

## Merge Conflicts -

git commit -am "sdsdsd"  -- -only works for modified file

git merge main

Then merge it in the VS code itself.

git status
git commit -am "merged in main"

### Undoing in Git -

So, we make any changes in the code and then added .. Now we want to change it (from the staged file)
git reset

Now, whatif I want to undo a commit-
git reset HEAD~1   ..(you are asking Git to point its header to the previous commit)

To see the log of all your commits -
git log

to undone several commmits -

git reset -hard <hash from that commit which you get in the log>

#### Fork -
You can fork other repositories and can then have access to them. And then raise a PR to add your changes over there.
Or I can branch off the code from this repo and do whatever I want with it.


=====

feature branches get merged to dev 
delete the feature
all changes from dev get into master
and we keep the dev as it is
